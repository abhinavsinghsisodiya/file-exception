        "   -;The key difference between compiled and interpreted languages lies in how they translate and execute code: compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution, while interpreted languages translate and execute code line by line during runtime.\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python0\n",
        " -;\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a process of resolving errors that occur in a program. This involves catching exceptions, understanding what caused them, and then responding accordingly. Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime when the program is being executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "    -;The purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to ensure that specific code, often resource cleanup, is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs within the try block or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python\n",

        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        " -; In Python, the __del__ method, also known as a destructor or finalizer, is automatically called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing for cleanup of resources before the object is deallocated.\n",

        "    -; In general, you should use the import statement when you need to use many attributes from a module, or when the module name is short and easy to remember. You should use the from statement when you only need to use a few attributes from a module, or when the module name is long and hard to remember\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python0\n",
        "   -;Python allows you to catch multiple exceptions in a single 'except' block by specifying them as a tuple. This feature is useful when different exceptions require similar handling logic. In this case, if either 'ExceptionType1' or 'ExceptionType2' is raised, the code within the 'except' block will be executed\n",

        "      -;The with statement in Python, when used with file handling, ensures that a file is automatically closed after its operations are complete, even if errors occur, simplifying resource management and preventing potential issues like file corruption or leaks.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "   -;In Python, exception handling involves using try, except, else, and finally blocks: the try block contains code that might raise an exception, except handles specific exceptions, else runs if no exception occurs, and finally ensures code runs regardless.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   13. Why is memory management important in Python0\n",
        "    -; Memory management is crucial in Python because it directly impacts program performance, stability, and resource utilization. Python's automatic memory management, including garbage collection and reference counting, helps developers write efficient code without needing to manually manage memory, preventing issues like memory leaks and crashes.\n",

        "       -;Python's garbage collection algorithm is very useful for opening up space in the memory. Garbage collection is implemented in Python in two ways: reference counting and generational. When the reference count of an object reaches 0, the reference counting garbage collection algorithm cleans up the object immediately\n",

        "\n",
        "       16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling0\n",
        "        -;In exception handling, the else block is executed only if no exceptions are raised within the preceding try block. It allows you to execute code that should run only when the try block executes successfully, enhancing the program's flow and clarity.\n",

        "\n",
        "        17. F What are the common logging levels in Python\n",

        "    18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "    -;he only real difference between the os.fork and multiprocessing.Process is portability and library overhead, since os.fork is not supported in windows, and the multiprocessing framework is included to make multiprocessing.Process work. This is because os.fork is called by multiprocessing.Process, as this answer backs up.\n",
        "\n",
        "The important distinction, then, is os.fork copies everything in the current process using Unix's forking, which means at the time of forking both processes are the same with PID differences. In Window's, this is emulated by rerunning all the setup code before the if __name__ == '__main__':, which is roughly the same as creating a subprocess using the subprocess library.\n",
        "\n",
        "For you, the code snippets you provide are doing fairly different things above, because you call external_function in main before you open the new process in the second code clip, making the two processes run in series but in different processes. Also the pipe is unnecessary, as it emulates no functionality from the first code.        \n",

        " 21.  What is the logging module in Python used for\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python0\n",
        "    -; To manually raise an exception in Python, use the raise statement. Here is an example of how to use it: Copied! In this example, the calculate_payment function raises a ValueError exception if the payment_type is not either \"Visa\" or \"Mastercard\".\n",

        "\n",
        "    25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications\n",
        "     -; Multithreading minimizes the time required for context switching compared to switching between separate processes, as threads within the same process share the same memory space and can switch more quickly. This results in reduced overhead and improved system responsiveness.\n",
